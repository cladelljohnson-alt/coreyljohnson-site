      <p class="mb-4">Young adult readers love nothing more than a story that pulls them to the edge of their seat. When the plot centers on a disappearance, the pages almost turn themselves. But for many years those missing from the story page were Black characters themselves. In 1965, children’s literature critic Nancy&nbsp;Larrick analyzed more than 5,000 books published between 1962 and 1964 and found only <strong>40</strong> that contained contemporary African‑American characters. That “all‑white world” sparked outrage and helped spur the creation of awards and organizations to amplify Black voices. Despite progress since then, Black protagonists remain rare in YA thriller shelves—and rarer still in mysteries centered on missing girls.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">This post shines a light on that gap while celebrating authors who are changing it. We’ll explore why representation in thrillers matters, recommend standout books with Black leads, and introduce Corey&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Johnson’s latest YA thriller <em>They&nbsp;Never&nbsp;Came&nbsp;Home</em>, a gripping mystery that demands your attention.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Why representation in YA thrillers matters</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">A good mystery should be inclusive; anyone should be able to see themselves in the high stakes, clever clues and heart‑stopping reveals. When Black teens are absent from these stories, it sends an unspoken message about whose stories are worth telling. It also skews readers’ perceptions of danger. Studies show that society pays less attention to missing Black girls, a disparity often mirrored in fiction.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Representation isn’t just about fairness—it affects how readers interpret the world. When books feature Black characters facing (and solving) complex mysteries, they help normalize the idea that Black lives are worthy of headline attention and heroic narratives. They also widen the audience for YA thrillers, opening the genre to readers who might have felt overlooked. The good news: a new generation of writers is filling the gap.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Spotlight: <em>They&nbsp;Never&nbsp;Came&nbsp;Home</em> by Corey&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Johnson</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Three girls vanish from a small Tennessee town. Parents whisper, journalists descend and everyone asks the same question: <strong>Where are they?</strong> In this tense YA thriller, Corey&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Johnson introduces us to <strong>Jaylen</strong>, a Black teen whose cousin is among the missing. As rumors swirl and fear spreads, Jaylen undertakes his own investigation when he realizes that law enforcement isn’t looking hard enough. The search uncovers buried secrets about the town—and about Jaylen’s family—that will keep you guessing until the last page.</p>
      <blockquote class="mb-4 italic border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4">“They Never Came Home is a gripping exploration of how communities respond when Black girls go missing—and who is left to do the searching.”</blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4"><em>They&nbsp;Never&nbsp;Came&nbsp;Home</em> blends fast‑paced mystery with an unflinching look at race, media bias, and the bonds of family. It’s perfect for teens and adults who enjoy thrillers that do more than entertain; they challenge readers to think. <a href="https://a.co/d/cVwd3TI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">Read it on Amazon</a> and see why this YA thriller deserves a place on your shelf.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">8 other YA thrillers featuring Black protagonists</h2>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">1. <em>Monday’s Not Coming</em> by Tiffany&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Jackson</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">When Claudia’s best friend Monday doesn’t show up for the first day of school, nobody seems concerned—until months go by and Monday is still missing. Claudia’s quest to find her friend exposes painful truths about how society responds when Black girls disappear. Jackson’s novel blends a twisting timeline with social commentary that will resonate with fans of <em>They Never Came Home</em>.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">2. <em>When You Look Like Us</em> by Pamela&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Harris</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Jay and his sister Nicole know that when you’re Black and live in a public‑housing complex, people assume the worst. So when Nicole goes missing and the police shrug it off, Jay realizes it’s up to him to bring her home. This contemporary mystery tackles stereotypes head‑on while delivering nail‑biting suspense.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">3. <em>Allegedly</em> by Tiffany&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Jackson</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Mary B. Addison was convicted of killing a baby when she was nine years old—but did she actually do it? Now seventeen and living in a group home, she faces a new crisis when she becomes pregnant. <em>Allegedly</em> isn’t a missing‑girl thriller, but its portrait of a Black teen caught in a web of injustice shares themes of bias and unreliable narratives.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">4. <em>Fake ID</em> by Lamar&nbsp;Giles</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Nick Pearson has spent his life in witness protection thanks to his father’s testimony against a crime syndicate. When Nick’s friend Eli is found dead, Nick must solve the murder without blowing his own cover. Giles’s novel is packed with twists, humor and a smart Black protagonist navigating danger at every turn.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">5. <em>Light It Up</em> by Kekla&nbsp;Magoon</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">This companion to <em>How It Went Down</em> centers on the aftermath of a police shooting of an unarmed Black teen. Though not strictly a missing‑person story, <em>Light It Up</em> is a timely thriller that examines media narratives and community responses. Readers who appreciate social commentary in their mysteries will find much to discuss.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">6. <em>The Buried Bones Mystery</em> (Clubhouse Mysteries #1) by Sharon&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Draper</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">For younger YA readers, Draper’s Clubhouse Mysteries series offers a classic whodunit vibe. In this first installment, four friends—the Black boys of the Black Dinosaurs Club—discover a set of bones and a mysterious message. The boys’ determination to uncover the truth mirrors the amateur sleuthing in <em>They Never Came Home</em>.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">7. <em>The Forest of Stolen Girls</em> by June Hur</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Set in 15th‑century Korea, this historical YA thriller follows a young woman searching for her missing sister. While not by a Black author, it features women of color and a gripping disappearance. It’s a great pick for readers who enjoy atmospheric mysteries and strong female leads.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">8. <em>The Taking of Jake Livingston</em> by Ryan&nbsp;Douglass</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Jake can see ghosts—a talent he’s used to ignoring until the vengeful spirit of a school shooter begins to torment him. This paranormal thriller mixes supernatural chills with commentary on trauma and race. Fans of <em>They Never Came Home</em> will appreciate Douglass’s willingness to tackle tough topics within a page‑turning plot.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">How to pick your next read</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">With so many intriguing titles, how do you choose? Consider these factors:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Theme:</strong> Do you want contemporary realism (<em>Monday’s Not Coming</em>), historical settings (<em>The Forest of Stolen Girls</em>) or paranormal elements (<em>The Taking of Jake Livingston</em>)?</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Tone:</strong> Some books lean into hard‑hitting social critique, while others prioritize puzzle‑solving fun. Decide whether you’re looking for emotional depth, pure suspense or a mix.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Age range:</strong> YA thrillers can vary from upper middle‑grade (Sharon Draper) to mature YA (Tiffany D. Jackson’s books tackle heavy themes).</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Length:</strong> If you’re short on time, a 300‑page mystery might be a better fit than a 500‑page epic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">If you’re still torn, start with the book that tackles the issues closest to your heart—whether it’s media bias, familial bonds or supernatural scares—and build your TBR from there.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">1. Why are so few YA thrillers centered on Black protagonists?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Historically, publishers have prioritized stories featuring white characters. Nancy Larrick’s 1965 article “The All‑White World of Children’s Books” highlighted that fewer than one percent of books published in the early 1960s included contemporary African‑American characters. While representation has improved, systemic biases still influence which manuscripts get published and promoted. Thankfully, more editors and readers are seeking diverse voices, leading to the rise of books like <em>They Never Came Home</em>.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">2. Is <em>They Never Came Home</em> appropriate for younger teens?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The novel tackles heavy themes—missing teens, racial bias and community trauma—so it’s best suited for readers aged 14 and up. Parents and educators should consider the maturity of individual readers. That said, its honest portrayal of media bias and family bonds makes it a valuable discussion starter.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">3. Are these books available as audiobooks?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Yes! Most of the titles listed, including <em>They Never Came Home</em>, <em>Monday’s Not Coming</em> and <em>When You Look Like Us</em>, are available in audiobook format. Listening can be a great way to experience the story’s suspenseful pacing and emotional beats.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">4. How can I support more African‑American YA thrillers?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Buy or borrow the books and leave reviews! Publishers pay attention to sales and buzz. Request these titles at libraries, include them on school reading lists and recommend them to friends. You can also follow Black authors on social media and share their work.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">5. What should I read after <em>They Never Came Home</em>?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">If you loved the mix of mystery and social commentary, try Tiffany D.&nbsp;Jackson’s novels (<em>Monday’s Not Coming</em>, <em>Allegedly</em>) or Pamela&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Harris’s <em>When You Look Like Us</em>. For a historical twist, <em>The Forest of Stolen Girls</em> offers a completely different setting with similar stakes.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">6. Where can I find more diverse YA recommendations?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Check out book blogs and organizations that spotlight diverse literature, such as The Brown Bookshelf’s annual 28 Days Later series and your local library’s lists. Many librarians curate lists of YA books by Black authors across genres.</p>
