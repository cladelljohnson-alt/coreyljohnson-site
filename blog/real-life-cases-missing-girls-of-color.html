      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Real‑Life Cases of Missing Girls of Color</h1>
      <p class="mb-4">Fictional mysteries often begin with a disappearance and end with answers. In real life, families of missing girls of color rarely get closure—or attention. A glance at police bulletins reveals that thousands of Black and Brown girls go missing every year, yet their stories barely make headlines. This imbalance echoes the long history of erasing Black children from storytelling. In the early 1960s, critic Nancy Larrick documented that out of more than 5,000 children’s books reviewed, only 40 featured contemporary African‑American characters【992448684961857†L395-L404】. Today, while representation in publishing has improved, media coverage of missing Black girls remains woefully lacking.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The term “missing white woman syndrome” describes how news outlets devote disproportionate attention to cases involving white women and girls, while similar disappearances of women of color receive little coverage. This disparity has deadly consequences. Publicity can bring resources, tips and pressure on law enforcement; its absence leaves families to search alone. Organizations like the Black and Missing Foundation (BAMFI) report that missing persons cases for Black girls often stall without the media spotlight. Families are told their loved ones “probably ran away” or “will turn up.”</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Raising awareness about real cases isn’t about fearmongering—it’s about equity. The same factors that make thrillers compelling (mystery, urgency, justice) apply to real‑world disappearances. The difference is that readers can influence outcomes by paying attention, sharing information and supporting advocacy groups. Authors like Corey L. Johnson weave these realities into fiction so readers see the parallels and feel motivated to act.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Stories behind the statistics</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Numbers can feel abstract, so here are a few representative scenarios drawn from news reports and advocacy organizations:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>The runaway assumption:</strong> A 15‑year‑old Black girl goes missing in a major city. Police label her a runaway and delay issuing an Amber Alert. By the time investigators act, crucial hours have passed. Her family organizes search parties while local media remain silent.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Unbalanced coverage:</strong> Two teens disappear on the same weekend—one white, one Latina. National networks cover the white girl’s story extensively, while the Latina girl’s case receives a brief mention. Both families struggle, but the disparity in attention impacts tips and resources.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Community vigilance:</strong> In a small town, a Black teenager fails to return home after practice. Knowing how often authorities overlook missing kids of color, her neighbors mobilize immediately. They flyer neighborhoods, call local news stations and pressure police to act. Their rapid response helps locate her within 48 hours.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">These examples show patterns: assumptions about behavior, selective empathy from news outlets and the power of collective action. Fictional stories like <em>They Never Came Home</em> mirror these dynamics, offering both catharsis and a call to remain vigilant.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">How you can help</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Reading about real cases can feel overwhelming, but there are concrete ways to support missing girls of color:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Share alerts:</strong> Follow organizations like BAMFI and local police departments on social media. When they post missing persons notices, share them widely. Visibility can lead to tips.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Donate:</strong> Contribute to nonprofits that provide search resources and support to families. Even small amounts help fund flyers, volunteer trainings and media outreach.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Advocate:</strong> Contact media outlets and ask for equal coverage of missing persons cases, regardless of race. Encourage your community to attend vigils and search events.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Educate:</strong> Talk to young people about personal safety and bias. Encourage them to look out for each other and report suspicious situations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">Above all, listen to families. They are the experts on their loved ones and the leaders of search efforts. Amplify their voices rather than speaking over them.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">1. Why do missing girls of color get less media coverage?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Implicit bias plays a major role. Newsrooms often assume their audience relates more to white victims, leading to disproportionate coverage. There’s also a stereotype that Black girls are more likely to run away or engage in risky behavior, which reduces urgency. Advocates urge journalists to question these assumptions.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">2. What organizations focus on missing Black children?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The Black and Missing Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both track cases and provide resources. Local grassroots groups often step up when official systems fail.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">3. How do fictional stories like <em>They Never Came Home</em> help?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Fiction can humanize statistics. By following a relatable character through a fictional investigation, readers experience the frustration and fear families feel. It can spark empathy, prompt self‑reflection and inspire readers to pay attention to real cases.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">4. Do law enforcement agencies treat all missing persons the same?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Policies vary by jurisdiction, but advocates note patterns of slower responses and fewer resources when the missing person is Black or Brown. Training and accountability can help reduce disparities, but community pressure is often necessary.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">5. What role can schools play?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Schools can educate students about media literacy and bias, teach safety awareness and partner with families in early intervention when a student goes missing. Counselors can provide support and help coordinate search efforts.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">6. Where can I find more information?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Visit the Black and Missing Foundation’s website, follow advocacy groups on social media and support journalists who cover these issues. Documentaries, podcasts and news articles also shed light on the crisis.</p>
