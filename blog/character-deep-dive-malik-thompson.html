      <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Character Deep Dive: Malik Thompson of <em>They Never Came Home</em></h1>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">Some protagonists win you over with charm. Malik Thompson wins you with <em>clarity</em>. He notices what others ignore, hears what the town refuses to say, and keeps asking questions long after polite people would've gone quiet. He's a teen with Queens-bred instincts dropped into a small Southern town where the truth doesn't travel far—but secrets do.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Who Malik Is (Without Spoilers)</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Eyes open:</strong> Malik reads rooms the way some folks read headlines—quick, skeptical, precise.</li>
        <li><strong>Protective by reflex:</strong> Once you're his people, he's not leaving you behind. Not when it's messy, not when it's dangerous.</li>
        <li><strong>Allergic to silence:</strong> "Let it go" isn't a worldview; it's a dare. When others look away, he looks closer.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">What He Wants vs. What He Fears</h2>
      <p class="mb-2"><strong>Want:</strong> Justice that actually means something—answers, accountability, and a life where the vulnerable don't vanish in plain sight.</p>
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Fear:</strong> Failing the people who depend on him. Becoming another bystander with a good excuse.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Strengths That Make the Story Move</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Pattern-spotter:</strong> He connects dots—history, rumor, routine—and sees the shape of things early.</li>
        <li><strong>Courage with a cost:</strong> He'll knock on the door everyone avoids, but he knows every knock has consequences.</li>
        <li><strong>Relational gravity:</strong> He builds trust slowly and holds it tightly; friends become anchors, not extras.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Flaws That Keep Him Human</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Control streak:</strong> If danger's nearby, he'd rather carry it himself. That saves others—and sometimes isolates him.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspicion of authority:</strong> Useful in a town of half-truths, complicated when he needs cooperation.</li>
        <li><strong>All-in loyalty:</strong> Once he's in, he's <em>in</em>. Detours can feel like betrayals of the mission.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">The Town as a Pressure Cooker</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Malik isn't just up against a mystery; he's up against a <em>map</em>—the way streets bend around old loyalties, how gossip travels faster than facts, how history hides in everyone's routines. The town is a character, and Malik is the reader who refuses to skim.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Why Readers Root for Him</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Integrity that stings:</strong> He tells the truth even when it tilts the room.</li>
        <li><strong>Love with teeth:</strong> His care doesn't sound soft—it sounds determined.</li>
        <li><strong>Hope that works:</strong> He doesn't wait for rescue. He organizes it.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Micro-Moment (Vibe, Not Spoiler)</h2>
      <p class="mb-6"><em>He stands in the doorway of a too-quiet house. The air smells like rain and Lysol—fresh, but wrong. The clock ticks like it has something to say. He doesn't call out. He listens. Because sometimes the loudest thing in a room is what's missing.</em></p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Themes He Carries</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Loyalty vs. comfort:</strong> Doing what's right will cost you something; Malik pays in full.</li>
        <li><strong>Belonging:</strong> Home isn't just geography; it's the people you'll stand in front of when the storm hits.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice:</strong> In a town built on silence, a question is an act of courage.</li>
      </ul>
