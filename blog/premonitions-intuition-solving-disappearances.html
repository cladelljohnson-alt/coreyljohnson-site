      <p class="mb-4">What if your instincts could lead you to the truth? Many young adult thrillers lean on classic detective work—magnifying glasses, hidden clues and suspects with shaky alibis. But a growing subgenre blends mystery with a touch of the supernatural, giving protagonists abilities that border on premonition. These stories don’t just entertain; they explore how gut feelings and uncanny gifts can become tools of survival, especially when the missing are girls of color.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Intuition isn’t merely a mystical plot device. Research into human cognition shows that “gut feelings” often stem from subconscious pattern recognition. In fiction, heightened intuition provides a metaphor for the ways marginalized communities sense danger before others do. For Black teens, hyper‑awareness is a survival skill—one that becomes life‑saving in thrillers where institutions fall short.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">One upcoming YA thriller, <em>Needy Little Things</em>, follows Sariyah, a Black teen with a “need‑sensing” ability. When her best friend goes missing, Sariyah’s strange gift becomes her only lead. She feels the urgency of people’s needs and uses that pull to follow the trail. The premise resonates because it literalizes the intuition many Black women and girls develop in order to protect themselves and their communities. Though the book adds speculative flair, the underlying message is grounded in truth: sometimes you have to trust your instincts when systems ignore you.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Gut feelings in real life and fiction</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Everyone experiences moments when a voice whispers, “Something isn’t right.” Psychologists suggest that intuition is our brain’s way of quickly processing cues that don’t reach conscious awareness—body language, patterns and past experiences. In communities where missing persons cases are often dismissed, this intuition becomes critical. Parents, siblings and friends often sense that something is wrong long before authorities take them seriously. In fiction, authors amplify this idea through supernatural twists, giving characters abilities like dream visions, empathic connections or, in Sariyah’s case, the capacity to feel needs.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">In Corey L. Johnson’s <em>They Never Came Home</em>, intuition isn’t supernatural—it’s rooted in experience. Jaylen knows that when three girls vanish, the town’s uneasy calm hides secrets. He senses the biases shaping the investigation and trusts his gut enough to keep digging. His determination echoes how real communities mobilize around missing girls. Whether it’s a hunch or a mystical tug, trusting your instincts is often the first step toward justice.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Books blending mystery and the supernatural</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If you enjoy thrillers with a dash of the otherworldly, here are a few titles to add to your list:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2"><strong><em>Needy Little Things</em></strong> by Channelle Desamours – A 2025 debut where a Black teen with a need‑sensing ability races to find her missing friend before it’s too late.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong><em>The Taking of Jake Livingston</em></strong> by Ryan Douglass – Jake can see ghosts, but when a vengeful spirit targets him, his gift becomes a curse he must harness to save himself and others.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong><em>Winterwood</em></strong> by Shea Ernshaw – A girl descends from a line of witches and must use her inherited magic to discover what happened to a missing boy during a snowstorm.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong><em>Dreaming Darkly</em></strong> by Caitlin Kittredge – Orphaned Ivy has vivid dreams that blur into reality as she unravels the mysteries surrounding her family’s cursed estate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">These novels show that supernatural elements can heighten suspense without relying on violence. They allow characters to access hidden truths and challenge readers to question how they interpret reality. In stories centering Black teens, psychic gifts can also symbolize the burden of anticipating harm and the resilience required to confront it.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Trusting your intuition: lessons for readers</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Thrillers with premonitions encourage readers to listen to their own instincts. If something feels off, speak up. This applies to both personal safety and advocating for others—especially when you sense that a loved one’s disappearance isn’t being taken seriously. In many real cases, families have pushed past skepticism to keep searching, refusing to let the story fade. Fictional characters like Sariyah and Jaylen model this persistence.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">These stories also remind us that intuition is complemented by community. Sariyah doesn’t just follow her feelings; she enlists help and shares what she learns. Jaylen draws strength from friends and mentors. The message: trust your gut, but don’t go it alone. Collective action amplifies individual insight.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-10">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">1. Are premonitions and supernatural abilities common in YA thrillers?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">While many YA mysteries stick to realism, there’s a vibrant subgenre that blends suspense with fantasy. Authors use dreams, psychic connections and magical abilities to explore themes like trauma, intuition and identity. These elements can intensify the mystery and add layers of meaning.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">2. What is a “need‑sensing” ability?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">In <em>Needy Little Things</em>, Sariyah can feel the needs of people around her—physical or emotional. It’s a fictional manifestation of empathy turned into a navigational tool. Her power pulls her toward those who require help and becomes central to solving her friend’s disappearance.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">3. Do these books still address real‑world issues?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Absolutely. Even with supernatural twists, these thrillers tackle topics like missing girls of color, media bias, generational trauma and community solidarity. The speculative elements often serve as metaphors for real feelings of anxiety, vigilance and hope.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">4. Why combine mystery with fantasy?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Adding fantasy can make a thriller more accessible to readers who enjoy magical realism and can also symbolize the invisible forces at play in real life—intuition, faith and resilience. It widens the scope of the genre and allows for creative storytelling.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">5. How does <em>They Never Came Home</em> fit into this theme?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">While Johnson’s novel remains grounded in reality, Jaylen’s sharpened instincts drive the plot. He senses that something is wrong beyond the official explanations and trusts his gut to keep searching. His determination mirrors the intuitive leaps found in more fantastical mysteries.</p>
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-6">6. What should I read next?</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">If you like supernatural mysteries, try <em>Legendborn</em> by Tracy Deonn, where a Black teen is thrust into a secret society of magic and ancient legends while investigating her mother’s death. For more realistic missing‑person thrillers, revisit <em>Monday’s Not Coming</em> by Tiffany D. Jackson.</p>
